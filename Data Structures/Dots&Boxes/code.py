"""
You are to implement the core logic for the game Dots and Boxes.

There are two players who take turns connecting two adjacent dots on an n Ã— n grid. 
A move is represented by the coordinates of the two dots being connected. 
If a player completes a box (meaning they place the fourth and final edge around a square), they immediately win the game.

Your function should process a sequence of moves and determine if any player completes a box.
If a box is formed, return the name of the player who won. 
Otherwise, continue until all moves are processed.

You can assume input will either come interactively (via input()) or from an array of moves.
