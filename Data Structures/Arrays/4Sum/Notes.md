#### Key Idea

- Process the arrays in pairs
- Store the results of the sum and product of the frequencies from the first pair in a hashmap
- Process the second pair and check for - (num3 + num 4) in the hashmap
- If found, add the product of the freq from the hashmap and freq3 * freq4 to total counter
